# WheelOfFOrtunePrizeWheel

<p> This is a program I wrote to help me pick the winner of a free give away.  To use it you just need to change the names.txt file to have the names you would like to use.  Names should be on a new line for the program to correctly use the data.
  
You can download the mac or the windows program <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1XV5Gx2_TWLg9QkL1_EarkOSPOQBFpZBh" target="_blank">here</a>, or download the processing file and run with <a href="https://processing.org/download/" target="_blank">Processing</a>.  
  
It currently works for about 40 people but could be edited to work with more names.</p>
