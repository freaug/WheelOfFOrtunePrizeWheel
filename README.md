# WheelOfFOrtunePrizeWheel

<p> This is a program I wrote to help me pick the winner of a free give away.  To use it you just need to change the names.txt file to have the names you would like to use.  Names should be on a new line for the program to correctly use the data.
  
You can download the mac program <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1UkVEA7Pe587ebQULQh4vuKMwv4lJy3vX">here</a> or the windows program <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1ff0sFu6jflWMQqh_24mkz3R_vCUEnLrX">here</a>, or download the processing file and run with<a href="https://processing.org/download/">Processing</a>.
  
It currently works for about 40 people but could be edited to work with more names.</p>
